Mustard on the beat h*!
I was good on my own, that's the way it was, that's the way it was
You was good on the low for a faded f***, on some faded love
Shit, what the f*** you complaining for?
Feeling jaded huh?
Used to trip off that s*** I was kickin' to you
Had some fun on the run though I give it to you
But baby, don't get it twisted
You was just another n**** on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad b****
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage
Fuck your white horse and a carriage
Bet you never could imagine
Never told you you could have it
You needed me
Oooh, you needed me
To feel a little more, and give a little less
Know you hate to confess
But baby ooo, you needed me
You been rollin' around, s*** I'm rollin up
Light and roll it up
Break it down like a pound, s*** was never us
S*** was never us
That's the real on the real, are you serious?
How you feel, how you feel?
Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to ya
Had some fun on the run though, I give it to ya
But baby, don't get it twisted
You was just another n**** on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad b****
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage
F*** your white horse and a carriage
Bet you never could imagine
Never told you you could have it
You needed me
Oooh, you needed me
To feel a little more, and give a little less
Know you hate to confess
But baby ooo, you needed me
