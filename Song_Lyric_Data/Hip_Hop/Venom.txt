I got a song filled with s*** for the strong-willed
When the world gives you a raw deal
Set you off 'til you
Scream, "Piss off, screw you"
When it talks to you like you don't belong
Or tells you you're in the wrong field
When something's in your mitochondrial
'Cause it latched on to you, like
Knock knock, let the devil in, manevolent
As I've ever been, head is spinnin', this medicine
Screamin', "L-l-l-let us in"
L-l-lick like a salad bowl, Edgar Allen Poe
Bedridden, shoulda been dead a long time ago
Liquid Tylenol, gelatins, think my skeleton's meltin'
Wicked, I get all high when I think I've smelled the scent
Of elephant manure
Hell, I meant Kahl√∫a, screw it, to hell with it
I went through hell with accelerants and blew up
My-my-myself again, Volkswagen, tailspin
Bucket matches my pale skin, mayo and
Went from Hellmann's and being rail thin, Filet-o-Fish
Scribble Jam, Rap Olympics '97 Freaknik
How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida
Proof's room slept on floor of 'da motel then
Dr. Dre said, "Hell yeah"
And I got his stamp like a postcard, word to Mel-Man
And I know they're gonna hate but I don't care, I
Barely can wait to hit 'em with the snare and the bass
Square in the face, this f****** world better prepare to get laced
Because they're gonna taste my
Venom
(I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment, I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(When they get bit with the)
Venom
(I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment, I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(When they get bit with the)
I said knock knock, let the devil in
Shotgun p-p-pellets in the felt pen
Cocked, f*** around and catch a hot one
It-it's evident I'm not done
V-venomous, the thoughts spun like a web and you just caught in 'em
Held against your will like a hubcap or a mud flap
Beat strangler attack
So this ain't gonna feel like a love tap
Eat painkiller pills, f*** up the track
Like, what's her name at the wheel?
Danica Patrick
Threw the car into reverse at the Indy, end up crashin'
Into ya, look back and it's just mangled steel
My Mustang and the Jeep Wrangler grill
With the front smashed, much as my rear fender, assassin
Slim be a combination of an actual kamikaze and Gandhi
Translation, I will probably kill us both when I end up
Backin' into ya
You ain't gonna be able to tell what the f***** happenin'
To ya, when you're bit with the
Venom
Adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment, I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-w-when they get bit with the)
Venom
(I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment, I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-w-when they get bit with the)
I said knock knock, let the devil in, alien
E-E-Elliot phone home, ain't no tellin' when this chokehold
On this game will end, I'm loco
Became a Symbiote, so
My fangs are in your throat, ho
You're snake-bitten with my
Venom
With the ballpoint pen I'm
Gun cocked, bump stock, double-aught, buckshot
Tire thumper, a garrote
Tie a couple knots, fired up and caught fire
Juggernaut
Punk rock, b****, it's goin' down like Yung Joc
'Cause the Doc put me on like sunblock
Why the f*** not?
You only get one shot
Ate s*** 'til I can't taste it
Chased it with straight liquor
Then paint thinner, then drank 'til I faint
And awake with a headache and I take anything in
Rectangular shape, then I wait
To face the demons I'm bonded to
'Cause they're chasin' me but I'm part of you
So escapin' me is impossible
I latch onto you like a
Parasite, and I probably ruined your parents' life
And your childhood too
'Cause if I'm the music that y'all grew up on
I'm responsible for you r******* fools
I'm the supervillain dad and mom was losin' their marbles to
You marvel that? Eddie Brock is you
And I'm the suit, so call me
Venom
(I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment, I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-w-when they get bit with the)
Venom
(I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment, I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-w-when they get bit with the)
