We've been burnin' both ends
Keepin' the lights on
So I've been thinkin' we need
A little time alone
So whatcha say we cancel our plans?
Tonight, I'm only gonna be your man
Let's get some candles burnin'
And some records turnin'
All the lights down low
Take it nice and slow
The way your body's movin'
Keep doin' what you're doin'
To me all night long
Writin' our love song
Girl, I want it, gotta have it
Let the passion take us to a higher place
Makin' the kind of love we make
Well, there ain't no way, baby
To get me out this house
When you look this good
What could I even think about? Oh
Besides turnin' round and lockin' the door
Watchin' your red dress fall to the floor
Let's get some candles burnin'
And some records turnin'
All the lights down low
Take it nice and slow
The way your body's movin'
Keep doin' what you're doin'
To me all night long
Writin' our love song
Girl, I want it, gotta have it
Let the passion take us to a higher place
Makin' the kind of love we make
Kind of love we make
So whatcha say we cancel our plans?
Tonight, I'm only gonna be your man
Let's get some candles burnin'
Some records turnin'
All the lights down low
Take it nice and slow
The way your body's movin'
Keep doin' what you're doin'
To me all night long
Writin' our love song
Girl, I want it, gotta have it
Let the passion take us to a higher place
Girl, I want it, gotta have it
Let the passion take us to a higher place
Makin' the kind of love we make
Kind of love we make
Makin' the kind of love we make
