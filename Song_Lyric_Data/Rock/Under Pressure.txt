Mm-bah-dah
Dum-dum-bah-beh
Doo-ba-dum-ba-beh-beh
Pressure
Pushing down on me
Pushing down on you, no man ask for
Under pressure
That burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets
Um-ba-ba-beh
Um-ba-ba-beh
Dee-day-da
E-day-da, that's okay
It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming
"Let me out"
Tomorrow, gets me higher
Pressure on people
People on streets
Dey-dey-dey-mm-hm
Da-da-da-ba-ba
Okay
Chipping around, kick my brains 'round the floor
These are the days, it never rains, but it pours
Ee-do-ba-be
Ee-da-ba-ba-ba
Um-bo-bo
Be-lap
People on streets
Ee-da-de-da-de
People on streets
Ee-da-de-da-de-da-de-da
It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming
"Let me out"
Tomorrow, gets me higher, higher
Pressure on people
People on streets
Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence, but it don't work
Keep coming up with love, but it's so slashed and torn
Why? Why? Why?
Love (love, love, love, love)
Insanity laughs, under pressure we're breaking
Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love?
Give love, give love, give love, give love?
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to
Care for the people on the
Edge of the night (people on streets)
And love dares you
To change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves
Under pressure
Under pressure
