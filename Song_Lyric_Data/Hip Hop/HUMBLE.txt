Nobody pray for me
It been that day for me
Way (Yeah, yeah)
Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a n**** with some counterfeits, but now I'm countin’ this
Parmesan where my accountant lives, in fact, I'm downin' this
D’USSÉ with my boo bae, tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy your a** the world with my paystub
Ooh, that p**** good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris
AM to the PM, PM to the AM, funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know
B****, be humble (Hol' up, b****)
Sit down (Hol' up, lil’, hol’ up, lil' b****)
Be humble (Hol’ up, b****)
Sit down (Hol' up, sit down, lil', sit down, lil' b****)
Be humble (Hol’ up, hol' up)
B****, sit down (Hol' up, hol' up, lil' b****)
Be humble (Lil' b****, hol' up, b****)
Sit down (Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)
Be humble (Hol' up, hol' up)
Sit down (Hol' up, hol' up, lil', hol' up, lil' b****)
Be humble (Hol' up, b****)
Sit down (Hol' up, sit down, lil', sit down, lil' b****)
Be humble (Hol' up, hol' up)
B****, sit down (Hol' up, hol' up, lil' b****)
Be humble (Lil' b****, hol' up, b****)
Sit down (Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)
Who that n**** thinkin' that he frontin' on Man-Man? (Man-Man)
Get the f*** off my stage, I'm the Sandman (Sandman)
Get the f*** off my d***, that ain't right
I make a play f****** up your whole life
I'm so f****** sick and tired of the Photoshop
Show me somethin' natural like afro on Richard Pryor
Show me somethin' natural like a** with some stretch marks
Still I take you down right on your mama couch in Polo socks
Ayy, this s*** way too crazy, ayy, you do not amaze me, ayy
I blew cool from AC, ayy, Obama just paged me, ayy
I don't fabricate it, ayy, most of y'all be fakin', ayy
I stay modest 'bout it, ayy, she elaborate it, ayy
This that Grey Poupon, that Evian, that TED Talk, ayy
Watch my soul speak, you let the meds talk, ayy
If I kill a n****, it won't be the alcohol, ayy
I'm the realest n**** after all
B****, be humble (Hol' up, b****)
Sit down (Hol' up, lil’, hol’ up, lil' b****)
Be humble (Hol’ up, b****)
Sit down (Hol' up, sit down, lil', sit down, lil' b****)
Be humble (Hol’ up, hol' up)
B****, sit down (Hol' up, hol' up, lil' b****)
Be humble (Lil' b****, hol' up, b****)
Sit down (Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)
Be humble (Hol' up, hol' up)
Sit down (Hol' up, hol' up, lil', hol' up, lil' b****)
Be humble (Hol' up, b****)
Sit down (Hol' up, sit down, lil', sit down, lil' b****)
Be humble (Hol' up, hol' up)
B****, sit down (Hol' up, hol' up, lil' b****)
Be humble (Lil' b****, hol' up, b****)
Sit down (Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)
