Lickwood means "rewind" and gunshot means "forward"
You requested it, so we rewind
Yeah, way, way, way up
Turn it all up, yeah, look

I got enemies, got a lot of enemies
Got a lot of people tryna drain me of my energy
They tryna take the wave from a n****
F****** with the kid and pray for your n****

I got girls in real life tryna f*** up my day
F*** goin' online, that ain't part of my day
I got real s*** poppin' with my family too
I got n***** that can never leave Canada too (Six)
I got two mortgages, thirty million in total
I got n***** that'll still try fuckin' me over
I got rap n***** that I gotta act like I like
But my actin' days are over, fuck them n***** for life, yeah

I got enemies, got a lot of enemies
Got a lot of people tryna drain me of my energy
They tryna take the wave from a n****
F****** with the kid and pray for your n****

I got people talkin' down, man, like I give a f***
I bought this one a purse, I bought this one a truck
I bought this one a house, I bought this one a mall
I keep buyin' s***, just make sure you keep track of it all
I got b****** askin' me about the code for the Wi-Fi
So they can talk about their Timeline
And show me pictures of they friends
Just to tell me they ain't really friends
Ex-girl, she the female version of me
I got strippers in my life, but they virgins to me
I hear everybody talkin' 'bout what they gon' be
I got high hopes for you n*****, we gon' see
I got money in the courts 'til all my n***** are free
'Bout to call your a** a Uber, I got somewhere to be
I hear fairy tales 'bout how they gon' run up on me
Well, run up when you see me, then, and we gon' see

I got enemies, got a lot of enemies
Got a lot of people tryna drain me of my energy
They tryna take the wave from a n****
F****** with the kid and pray for your n****

Nah, f*** all of you n*****, I ain't finished
Y'all don't wanna hear me say it's a go
Y'all don't wanna see Win Win, 50 or Whoa
I got real ones livin' past Kennedy Road
I got real ones with me everywhere that I go
I'm tryna tell ya I got enemies, got a lot of enemies
Every time I see 'em, somethin' wrong with their memory
Tryna take the wave from a n****
So tired of savin' all these n*****, mayne
Yeah, run 'em

I got enemies, got a lot of enemies
Got a lot of people tryna drain me of my energy
They tryna take the wave from a n****
F****** with the kid and pray for your n****
(I'm off this)
