Oh, that's London On Da Track, run that s*** back
(We got London On Da Track)
Swervin'
How you look so perfect on your worst days?
Double C your purses, you deserve it
N***** in your DM, they be thirsty (thirsty)
And in person
But you're curvin'
Curvy little body, love your surface (surface)
Yeah, I'm all on your body, make you nervous
I like the way you keep up with your earnings
Yeah, it's okay, you be swervin'
I f*** you from the back and leave you turnin' (turnin')
The type to make you feel like I'm so worth it (worth it)
Blame my ex, that b****, she did me dirty (did me dirty)
Had me fall in love and then she curved me
(Curve me, don't go, swear to God I don't wanna leave you 'lone)
New Louboutin, you would think I'm bleedin' from my toes
D*** all inside of you, make you freeze, make you pose
I want you to get up on your knees and your toes
I see one of my enemies, they gon' freeze like they cold
I swear I ain't no killer, but test me if you want
You don't want my adrenaline rushin', leave me alone (leave me alone)
So much s*** up on my mind, I can't think straight
All my n***** rock designer like they scream (grrat)
Get that AP covered, diamonds with baguettes, yeah
I thought everything was right, that's when you left, yeah
Swervin' (swervin')

But you're curvin'
Curvy little body, love your surface (surface)
Yeah, I'm all on your body, make you nervous
I like the way you keep up with your earnings
Yeah, it's okay, you be swervin'
Where these b****** at? I'm in the V with the tints
Got the FN on my body and the clip on hollow tips
N***** say they gon' rob me and they still ain't do s***
Catch her waitin' in the lobby, and I'ma give her this d***
Man, where these n***** at? Man, where these n***** at?
We gon' pull up big bodies with the Rugers in the back
I got Rugers and the MAC's, pump leave a n**** flat
Talkin' hot, we spin the block, we gon' leave him where he at
Like, where these n***** at? Ayy, where these n***** at?
I'ma pull up in the big body with the f****** MAC
If the opps try to turn my song off, run it back
Used to have the pack in my long johns, now I rap
If a n**** wanna act out, got the MAC out
I ain't got no f****** back-up, that's a man down
I ain't got the f****** forty, knock his teeth out
Spin back with the Ruger, air the block out
Swervin' (swervin')
How you look so perfect on your worst days? (Worst days)
Double C your purses, you deserve it

So much s*** up on my mind, I couldn't think, yeah
All my n***** rock designer like they scream, yeah
Get that AP covered, diamonds with baguettes, yeah
Say my name in your song and it's lit, yeah
Been waiting for a n**** like this, yeah
