Pullin' out the coupe at the lot
Told 'em f*** 12, f*** SWAT
Bustin' all the bells out the box
I just hit a lick with the box
Had to put the stick in the box, mmh
Pour up the whole damn seal, I'ma get lazy
I got the mojo deals, we been trappin' like the '80s
She sucked a n**** soul, gotta Cash App
Told 'em wipe a n**** nose, say slatt, slatt
I won't never sell my soul, and I can back that
And I really wanna know where you at, at

I was out back where the stash at
Cruise the city in a bulletproof Cadillac (Skrrt)
'Cause I know these n***** after where the bag at (Yeah)
Gotta move smarter, gotta move harder
N**** try to get me for my water
I'll lay his a** down, on my son, on my daughter
I had the Draco with me, Dwayne Carter
Lotta n***** out here playin', ain't ballin'
I done put my whole arm in the rim, Vince Carter (Yeah)
And I know probably get a key for the quarter
Shawty barely seen in double C's, I bought 'em
Got a b**** that's looking like Aaliyah, she a model
I got the pink slip, all my whips is key-less
Compton, I'm about to get the key to the city
Patek like the sea, forgive me

Pullin' out the coupe at the lot
Told 'em f*** 12, f*** SWAT
Bustin' all the bells out the box
I just hit a lick with the box

I got the mojo deals, we been trappin' like the '80s

Hahaha, I been movin' 'em out
If Steelo with me, then he got the blues in the pouch (Yeah)
Took her to the forest, put the wood in her mouth
B****, don't wear no shoes in my house
The private I'm flyin' in, I never wan' fly again
I'll take my chances in traffic (Yeah)
She suckin' on d***, no hands with it
I just made the Rollie plain like a landing strip
I'm a 2020 president candidate
I done put a hundred bands on Zimmerman, s***
I been movin' real gangster, so that's why she picked a Crip
Shawty call me Crisco 'cause I pop my s***
Got it out the mud, there's nothin' you can tell me, yeah
When I had the drugs, I was street wealthy, yeah
